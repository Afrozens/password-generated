# Javascript - Password Generated
## Project Description:
Responsive Javascript vanilla application with the purpose of generating a variety of passwords with characters from uppercase to special. It also allows to show the user validations and indicating its security level. 
### Technologies:
- Modules Javascript
- JS Library: https://sweetalert2.github.io/
- CSS Library: https://jonsuh.com/hamburgers/
- Tailwind
- HTML
- Webpack
### Challenges:
Using JS modules allowed me to improve the organization of the application, I tried to use as semantic as possible in HTML since using Tailwind generates a verbose "index.html" file, I try to organize the content using semantic HTML, comments and style components with Tailwind. 

Already understanding the basics of ES6 I was able to generate several blocks of code in different module js files, to maneuver possible errors that were generated in an easier way than having everything in a file, a challenge was the validations and the organization in the "chars.js" file.

Configuring Webpack was my main problem because when I studied Webpack I didn't understand the basis of the function of this technology which is simply to encapsulate all the js modules in one, minify the HTML file and do these two things for the CSS file, I generated unnecessary plugins but, at the end I could understand its main function and fix this to launch the deploy.

### Implement in the future:
- Improve the validation of the security level of the generated passwords (**NO-CHECKED**).
- Implement a PIN generator (**NO-CHECKED**)
